Gun violence has been one of the most debated topics in the country over the past few years. In my new project, I created a tool to compare gun violence forecasts over time. The project uses data from [GunViolenceArchive.org](https://gunviolencearchive.org){:target="_blank"}, a not for profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States.
