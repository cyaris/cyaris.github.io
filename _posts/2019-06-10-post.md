Gun violence has been one of the most debated topics in the country over the past few years. In my new project, I developed a tool written JavaScript (using the D3.js library) to compare gun violence forecasts over time. The data comes from [GunViolenceArchive.org](https://gunviolencearchive.org){:target="_blank"}, a not-for-profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide online public access to accurate information on gun-related violence in the United States.
