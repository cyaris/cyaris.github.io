See my newest project, an interactive network analysis tool coded with both Python and JavaScript (using the D3.js library). The data has been sourced from [The Correlates of War (COW) Project](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war){:target="_blank"} to compare networks between countries at war.
