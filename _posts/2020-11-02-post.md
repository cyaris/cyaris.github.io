Catch a preview of my newest project, coded with both Python and JavaScript to create an interactive tool with D3.js. I'll be using data provided by [the Correlates of War](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war){:target="_blank"} to analyze and compare the networks between countries at war.<br><center>Enjoy!</center>
