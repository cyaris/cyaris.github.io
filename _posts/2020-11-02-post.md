Catch a preview of my newest project, coded in both Python and JavaScript. Using Python for preprocessing, I'm developing a tool with D3.js using data provided by [the Correlates of War](https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war){:target="_blank"}. The tool will leverage the interactivity of D3.js to analyze and compare the networks between countries at war.<br><center>Enjoy!</center>
