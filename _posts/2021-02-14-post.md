Sometimes coding is just a thing I like to do for fun. Try out my new D3.js firework launcher on the navbar. Credit is owed to Mike Rossetti's [D3.js Hanabi](http://bl.ocks.org/s2t2/53e96654487b4b0ef6e5){:target="_blank"} project for getting me started on coding my own D3.js fireworks.


<!-- Head over to the [About Me](https://cyaris.github.io/about_me/) section of my website for some fun new features (available on desktop only). Trigger the firework show by hovering until 100% of the photo has been revealed. Eager for more? Check out my laser vision in "Reveal My Laser Vision Mode." -->
