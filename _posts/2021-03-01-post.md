Sometimes coding is just a thing I like to do for fun. Head over to the [About Me](https://cyaris.github.io/about_me/) section of my website for some fun new features (available on desktop only). Trigger the fireworks show by hovering until 100% of the photo has been revealed. Eager for more? Check out my laser vision in "Reveal My Laser Vision Mode."
