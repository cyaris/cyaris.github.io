Hi there!

My name is Charlie. I live in Chicago and work for Live Nation as a Data Engineer. I attended Washington University in St. Louis for undergrad and have been learning data tools ever since. I'm particularly passionate about data accuracy, automation, and creating interactive tools for data storytelling. Aside from data, my interests include propagating plants, making music, reading my kindle, playing with my dog, and eating pizza.

Feel free to [reach out](../contact) or [read my resume](../resume) to learn more!
