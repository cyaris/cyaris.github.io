### Friendly Bio

Hi there!<br><br>My name is Charlie. I live in Chicago and I work for CreditNinja as a Data Management Associate. I attended Washington University in St. Louis for undergrad and have been learning data tools ever since (most recently became an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner). I’m particularly passionate about data science as a tool for better understanding the world. Aside from data, my interests include plants, music, my kindle, and pizza.<br><br>Feel free to reach out or [read my resume](../resume/) to learn more!
