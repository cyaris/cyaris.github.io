### Friendly Bio
Hi there!<br><br>My name is Charlie. I live in Chicago and recently graduated from the data science bootcamp at Metis. Prior to moving to Chicago and joining Metis, I attended Washington University in St. Louis for undergrad and lived in Seattle working as a Marketing Analyst. This role was highlighted by an initiative I took to automate my teamâ€™s workflow with SQL queries and macro functions. I'm particularly passionate about data science as a tool for better understanding the world. Aside from data, my interests include plants, music, my kindle, and pizza.<br><br>Feel free to reach out or [see my resume](../resume/) to learn more!
