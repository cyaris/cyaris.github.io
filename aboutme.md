### Friendly Bio
Hi there! My name is Charlie. I live in Chicago and recently graduated from the Metis data science bootcamp. Between college and joining Metis, I worked in Seattle as a Marketing Analyst where I automated my teamâ€™s workflow with SQL queries and macro functions. I'm particularly passionate about data science as a tool for better understanding the world. Outside of work, my hobbies include propagating plants, playing the guitar, reading my kindle, and eating pizza. Feel free to reach out and learn more!
