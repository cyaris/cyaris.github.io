### Friendly Bio

Hi there!<br><br>My name is Charlie. I live in Chicago and work for CreditNinja as a Data Management Associate. I attended Washington University in St. Louis for undergrad and have been learning data tools ever since (most recently became an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner). I’m particularly passionate about creating interactive tools for data storytelling. Aside from data, my interests include propagating plants, playing music, reading my kindle and eating pizza.<br><br>Feel free to reach out or [read my resume](../resume/) to learn more!
