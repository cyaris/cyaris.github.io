Gun violence has been one of the most debated topics in the country over the past few years. After each mass shooting, there seems to be a dismaying consensus that the next one is inevitable. I began exploring data on this topic by simply forecasting the future. Then, I became determined to answer a different question altogether...

Should tragedies like the Las Vegas shooting have been anticipated based on historical forecasts? Regardless of what the forecast is for next year (good or bad), how does this compare to our expectations? In other words, is our one year forecast right now in-line with our two-year forecast one year ago? No matter the topic, I always want to interpret a forecast within a historical context. Since forecasts are constantly updated with new data, it's crucial to monitor how they are changing over time.
