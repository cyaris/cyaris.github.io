Documentation page coming soon! Stay tuned for updates.

<!-- My goal for this project was to use interactivity as a tool for specific questions for forecasting. I hope this tool can be generalized to other topics/datasets in the future.
The questions were as follows:
How does a current forecast/time series model compare to our expectations?
By hovering...
How far back should we look to get an accurate forecast of future data points? -->
